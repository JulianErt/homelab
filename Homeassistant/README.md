## Seperate ZigbeeMQTT from Home Assistant in Proxmox
Within Proxmox VE I have my ZigbeeMQTT and MQTT broker servers seperated from my Home Assistant virtual machine. I found I get slightly better preformance out of my Zigbee devices doing it this way, plus it's easier to backup and feed all my Zigbee devices to a new Home Assistant server if needed.
